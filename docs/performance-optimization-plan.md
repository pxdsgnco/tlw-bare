## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. External Image Dependencies (Priority: CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: 138 external image references to `localhost:3845`
- **Impact**: Causes 83.2s LCP when external service is unavailable
- **Solution**: Migrate to optimized local assets or CDN

### 2. Background Image Usage (Priority: HIGH)
- **Issue**: Many components use CSS `backgroundImage` instead of Next.js Image
- **Impact**: No optimization, lazy loading, or modern format support
- **Components Affected**: LatestStories, FeaturedTrends, Nightlife components

### 3. Bundle Size Analysis Needed (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Current Bundle**: 99.6KB shared, largest page 118KB
- **Opportunity**: Identify unused code and optimize imports

## Performance Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Image Optimization (Immediate - Week 1)

#### 1.1 Asset Migration
- [ ] Audit all external image dependencies (138 references)
- [ ] Download and optimize critical images
- [ ] Set up local asset pipeline or CDN integration
- [ ] Configure proper image formats (WebP, AVIF with fallbacks)

#### 1.2 Next.js Image Component Migration
- [ ] Replace all CSS `backgroundImage` with Next.js Image component
- [ ] Implement proper sizing and priority flags
- [ ] Add lazy loading for below-fold images
- [ ] Configure image domains in next.config.ts

#### 1.3 Critical Resource Preloading
- [ ] Identify LCP image and add preload hint
- [ ] Implement responsive image loading
- [ ] Add proper alt text for accessibility

### Phase 2: Bundle Optimization (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Code Splitting
- [ ] Implement route-based code splitting
- [ ] Add dynamic imports for heavy components
- [ ] Optimize component imports (barrel exports)

#### 2.2 Dependency Optimization
- [ ] Analyze bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Implement tree shaking for lucide-react icons
- [ ] Optimize Tailwind CSS purging

#### 2.3 Advanced Next.js Features
- [ ] Enable ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for content pages
- [ ] Implement service worker for caching
- [ ] Add compression middleware

### Phase 3: Performance Monitoring (Week 3)

#### 3.1 Automated Performance Testing
- [ ] Set up Lighthouse CI in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Configure performance budgets
- [ ] Add Core Web Vitals monitoring

#### 3.2 Real User Monitoring
- [ ] Implement Vercel Analytics or similar
- [ ] Set up performance alerts
- [ ] Create performance dashboard
